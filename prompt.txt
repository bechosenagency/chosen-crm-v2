I'd like to create the login page for ChosenCRM.

Use the Executive Light theme defined in `claude.md`. This is a simple, centered login page for authenticated users — no need to include marketing features since the main website handles that.

### Layout:
- Full screen layout
- Centered card containing:
  - Logo
  - Email input
  - Password input
  - Sign In button (primary color: #00D6A1)
  - Optional: OAuth section below (Google button)
- Below the card: "Forgot password?" and "Don't have an account?" links

### Style Guide:
- Background: `#FFFFFF`
- Card: `#F8FAFC` with subtle shadow
- Form fields and button styled with Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Responsive on mobile and desktop
- Clean, high-end look — minimal distractions

### Tech:
- Next.js 15.4 App Router
- Place in `/app/login/page.tsx`
- Use components from `/components/ui/*` where possible

Only plan the layout and structure for now — don’t implement backend logic yet.
