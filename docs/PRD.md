9. AI Coaching Logic {#ai-logic}
Goal-Based Personalization Engine
Individual Goal Setting
During onboarding and quarterly reviews, each loan officer defines their personal targets:
Production Goals
Annual income target (e.g., "$150,000 this year")
Monthly loan volume (e.g., "8 loans per month")
Average loan size goals (e.g., "increase to $400K average")
Work-life balance parameters (e.g., "45 hours/week maximum")
Career Aspirations
Growth trajectory: "Become top producer" vs "Maintain steady business"
Market specialization: "Focus on jumbo loans" vs "First-time buyers"
Team ambitions: "Build a team" vs "Stay solo producer"
Long-term vision: Position in 1, 3, and 5 years
Personal Preferences
Work style: Morning person vs night owl
Communication preference: Phone warrior vs email expert
Energy patterns: Sprint and rest vs steady pace
Time blocks: Deep work periods vs flexible availability
